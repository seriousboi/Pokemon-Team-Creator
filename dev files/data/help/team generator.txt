Main use:
The team generator is the core functionality of this software, it will generate all the teams that stems from the starting team you gave it and
validate the requirements you chose , the pokemon used will be from the roster you picked.
The generation might take a lot of time if you gave it no starting team and/or a huge roster to build from.
If no team can match the requirements then no team will be suggested at the end of the generation and it will not prevent the generation from
taking a long time, so make sure to start with loose requirements.

Interface:
-At the left is the starting team that the generator will build from (empty by default), it is recommended to at least give one pokemon.
-At the top are the type sensitivity requirements (see the type sensitivity section for more informations).
-Under the starting team is the "add starting team" option, click on it to have access to the team manager from which you can choose the
starting team.
-Under the team is the "choose roster" option, click on it to have the available rosters offered at the right, then click on the roster from which
you want pokemons to be added.
-Under the starting team is the "have a mega" option, click on it to have only teams with a mega-evolution generated.

-At the right are the requirements, click on a criteria to increase the minimum amount of pokemons that fit the criteria that will be needed in
the generated teams.
For instance if you want balanced teams you could choose the following requirements (physical attacker:1, special attacker:1, physical wall:1,
special wall:1, rock setter:1, defoger:1, priority user:1).
And for stall teams (physical wall:3, special wall:3, spinner:1, defoger:1).
