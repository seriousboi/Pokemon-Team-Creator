Main use:
The team generator is the core functionality of this software, it will generate all the teams that stems from the starting team you gave it and
validate the requirements you chose , the pokemon used will be from the roster you picked.
The generation might take a lot of time if you gave it no starting team and/or a huge roster to build from.
If no team can match the requirements then no team will be suggested at the end of the generation and it will not prevent the generation from
taking a long time, so make sure to start with loose requirements.

Interface:
-At the left is the starting team that the generator will build from (empty by default), it is recommended to at least give one pokemon.
-At the top are the type sensitivity requirements (see the type sensitivity section for more informations).
