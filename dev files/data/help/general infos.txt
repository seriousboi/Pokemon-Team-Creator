The purpose of this software is to procedurally generate efficient strategic teams for singles Smogon formats of all pokemon generations.

How to use it:

-First it is recommended to create a part of a team using the team builder, put in the pokemons you know you want in your team.
This step is not necessary but is useful if you want a specific synergy in your team (such as Tapu-Howl in 7G).
The more pokemons you have in your pre-generation team the faster the generation will be.

-If you only want pokemons from a specific smogon tier you can skip this step.
If you want to play in a tier but dont mind having pokemons from lower tiers then you can create a personalized roster by fusing several
default rosters in the roster creator.
Be careful when doing this since the time of the generation will greatly increase with the size of the roster.

-You can now use the team generator by selecting the team part you want to generate from, the roster from which pokemons will be added and
the requirements you want your team to fit.
After the generation you will be shown all the teams that fit your requirements so you can save the ones you are interested in.

Other functionalities:

-The team manager allows you to look at the teams you have saved.

-The type chart and the pokedex corresponding to the generation can be consulted.

-The generation can be changed in the options.
