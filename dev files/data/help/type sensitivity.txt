The type sensitivity of a team to a certain type is the number of pokemons that resist or are immune to that type minus the number of
pokemons that are weak to that type.

One important thing to note is that this type sensitivity does not take into account how much a pokemon is weak or resist to a type.
So a pokemon with an immunity with two pokemons with a regular weakness will result in a type sensitivity of -1.
And a pokemon with a strong weakness (x4) with two pokemons with a regular resistance will result in a type sensitivity of 1.


Sensitivity requirements of the team generator:

Those requirements are the minimum type sensitivity (for each type) of the teams that will be generated.

Having all the requirements at 0 will ensure that the teams generated are balanced type-wise.
Most balanced teams have many type sensitivities above 0 but the requirements are a minimum so those stronger teams will still be
generated.

The requirements can be toyed with to get specific teams to be generated.
If you want a team that has no trouble switching a lot with stealth rocks on your side you could set the rock type sensitivity at 3.
If you want a team that counters rain teams you could set the water type sensitivity at 3 and the ice type sensitivity at 2. (or just use TTar)
If you want to give the generator more leeway (useful if you gave a starting team that is unbalanced) you could set all the typesensitivities
at -1.

Do not be too restrictive with your requirements, setting all the type sensitivities at 1 will most likely result in having no team generated.
Remember that those requirements are minimums and that the best teams will always be generated.
