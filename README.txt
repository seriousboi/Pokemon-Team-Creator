The purpose of this software is to procedurally generate efficient strategic teams for singles Smogon formats of all pokemon generations.

To run this software you only need to download the PTC archive, unzip it and make sure the data folder is in the same directory as the exe file when you run it.
The software might be recognized as a virus, I am working on correcting this issue.

So far the tiers that you can generate teams from are:
7G OU
8G OU

If you want to use the generator for a tier not implemented yet:
-You will have to use the roster creator to create a roster containing the pokemons of the tier.
-Also you must not use the roles requirements (the ones at the right in the team generator), you can still use the type sensitivity requirements.
